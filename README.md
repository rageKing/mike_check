Hello World!
This is rageKing, and I am declaring that I will be proficient in HTML, CSS, C, JScript and Unity3D in 30 days.
I have a bit of previous experience in all of those, but even with that it's going to be  a tad bit difficult. 
BUT, I WILL FREAKiN' CONQUER MY GOALS, HELLS YEAH!!!
Also throw in an Android App in the basket too, will also CRUSH that!
